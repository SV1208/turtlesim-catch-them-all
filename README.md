## ðŸ“š About the Project

This project was completed as part of the **Turtlesim Catch Them All** exercise featured in the "[ROS 2 for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/)" course by **Edouard Renard** on Udemy.

It demonstrates how to spawn multiple turtles in the `turtlesim` simulator and catch them with another turtle using ROS 2 launch files, subscribers, publishers, and simple logic to "catch" targets.
